## Contributing
We ❤️ contributions! Currently, our public projects are centered around the [ic-design system](https://github.com/mi6/ic-design-system). We build a lot of stuff that needs to be quick-to-build, usable and always accessible. We build using a lot of different tech, so creating something that can be consistently accessible and usable across different stacks is critical for us.

The Design System is being used to build our powerful, flexible and complex capabilities that help keep the UK safe and prosperous.
